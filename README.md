# RESTful API with User Authentication

A RESTful API with user authentication is an excellent foundational backend project because it demonstrates core skills that employers look for. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Core Components

1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Create endpoints for user signup, login, and logout
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication
   - Add password hashing and security best practices
   - Include email verification (optional but impressive)

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Define different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user)
   - Create middleware to verify permissions
   - Restrict access to certain endpoints based on roles

3. **CRUD Operations**
   - Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
   - Structure endpoints following RESTful conventions
   - Add proper validation for all inputs

4. **Database Integration**
   - Connect to a database (SQL or NoSQL)
   - Design efficient schemas/models
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations

## Technical Considerations

- **Security**: Implement rate limiting, input sanitization, and protection against common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS)
- **Documentation**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI to document your endpoints
- **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests for your API endpoints
- **Logging**: Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring

## Project Ideas to Implement This

I can  apply this structure to several domains:
- Personal finance tracker
- Blog platform with user comments
- Task management system
- Recipe sharing platform
